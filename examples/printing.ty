// printing is very simple in the Taylor language
// to write a string with a newline, surround text with double quotes (")
"this is a newline-ended string!"
// to write a string with no newline, surround text with single quotes (')
'this will not print a newline. '
// to show the result of a math expression, simply write it on a line
'result of 5 * 2: '
5 * 2 // produces: 10
