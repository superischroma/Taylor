-- RADIAN AND DEGREE MODE --
You may switch between radian and degree mode for trigonometric functions by typing on a single line:

radians

or

degrees

These modes can be accessed without toggling by using the rad and deg functions

-- TEXT TO SCREEN --
You can print out to the screen by surrounding text in double or single quotes on its own line.
Single quotes will not create a newline while double quotes will.

-- TRANSCENDENTALS --
There are a decent amount of pre-defined functions and constants that are provided by default.

sin(angle): Calculates the sine value of the angle provided in the current calculator mode
cos(angle): Calculates the cosine value of the angle provided in the current calculator mode
tan(angle): Calculates the tangent value of the angle provided in the current calculator mode
...
log(x, b): Calculates the base-b logarithm of x
lg(x): Calculates the base-10 logarithm of x
ln(x): Calculates the natural (base-e) logarithm of x
exp(x): Calculates e^x
sqrt(x): Calculates the square root of x
pi: The ratio of the circumstance of a circle to its diameter
e: The natural constant
rad(d): Converts angle d in degrees into radians
deg(r): Converts angle r in radians into degrees
abs(x): Calculates the absolute value of x
inc(path): Includes the file located at path into this file
hirt(x, n): Calculates the higher-order nth root of x
